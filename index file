<p>I am the man! I have done it again.</p>
<p> You should subscribe to me, otherwise known as Inferno Animations on Youtube for good animations. I will have more great ones if you like my animations and videos. Thank you for stopping by, enjoy your day.</p><p> Here's one of my favorite songs. I do not own this song, but I choose to listen to it because it is one I love. This video-placement is non sponsored.</p>

<p><h2> <a name="Why Animate?"> Why did I choose to animate? </a> </h2></p> 
<p>I chose to animate because I've always loved to wake up, get on tv and see what animated scenes were on. I was always inspired and uplifted by the animations, so I figured maybe I should be an animator. That and I've always loved the idea of being a content ceator, so I thought "If other people can do it, why can't I?" and bam!, my love of creating animations was born. Now, I love to get up, ask my friends for ideas, and then animate the ideas. I am saving up for a tablet to draw my animations on, so I will be done with the softwares soon. I am also starting to game which I think is nice.But I mainly chose to animate because I know I can put a smile on someone's face.</p>
My most currently used software is called: "Draw Cartoons 2" and I know it's on Android, but I'm not sure about whether it's on IOS or not.

<h2><a name="Backstory">My backstory... </a></h2>
<BR><p> I grew up in a small town known as Belfast. No, not in Ireland. Belfast is also the name of a small town in New York state. I lived there for about 10 years with a pretty simple family. Mom,Dad,two brothers and one sister. We were quite happy, until we found out that we had family in Tennessee, so we moved there. We still live here(Tennessee), but it's gone uphill by a lot. I can do better at school(B+ average) and I can also make great animations, whereas, I used to spend my freetime reading books that not even my teachers could read 24/7 and barely ever being on my computer. That's another thing, I've been through two computers sice we moved, technically not, I'm on my second now. It's a stunningly nice one. A chromebook(I can hear all the tech nerds slowly dying because of my choices), which I think is amazing.

<h1><a name="Techy"> My tech abilites </a></h1>
<p>Lots of people don't know this, but I am a partial tech nerd. It all started as a thing I wanted to have in common with my father, he has enough tech knowledge to be one of the Pentagon's tech people. In fact, I often ask lots of computer based questions, it's how I started learning(not learning how to code though). I started taking lessons online in coding a few months ago, but I never put them to use. Now, I've decided I will. I've coded this entire website(except for the two images and the youtube video url) and I used both HTML and CSS to design it. I'm an amateur which is why there's extra space everywhere, but it's also my first website. I do know how to do it which is good though. I also know a lot about Android, but not a lot about IOS. Other than that, I don't have much technological experience, besides how to animate and how to make videos.L0L. </p>
